# Concurrency in Go
This repository is a collection of tasks, exercises, and projects aimed at helping me better understand the concepts covered in the book **"Concurrency in Go"** by Katherine Cox-Buday. By taking on different tasks, I aim to reinforce the concepts discussed in the book, experiment with concurrent programming in Go, and solidify my understanding of concurrency patterns, primitives, and best practices.

The goal is to learn by doing—building small concurrent programs and exploring how Go's concurrency model can be applied to real-world problems.
